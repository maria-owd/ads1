Multiply two numbers using the lattice multiplication technique, that
is a visual technique for multiplying multi-digit numbers using a grid (lattice) with diagonal
lines through each cell. It breaks down the problem into smaller steps by multiplying individual
digits in each box and then adding the numbers along the diagonals to find the final product.
